- Ensure Endless Mode Button is enabled upon beating Normal Mode. Should work even after a page refresh
- This update is also serving as a test to see if guess history properly remains the same even if an update has happened. In the past, updates would completely reset the day, so we'll see if it happens this time.

This update aims to fix some of the issues people recently submitted in the bug feedback form! Thanks to those who reported! It really helps me out!

- Fixed wording in Help window that implied Endless Mode unlocked after Normal and Hard mode
- Fixed Iwamuro Togo's picture (used to be Teradomari Motoki's image)
- Endless Mode now has stats. Originally did not have stats and displayed nothing, with the text being either Normal or Hard mode's, depending on which you played last
- The stats graph's bars now properly change color when switching between dark and light mode
- Fixed the sharing message not properly showing if you got the character name correct, but it was either their timeskip version or vice versa
- Hopefully fixed some page refresh issues, please let me know if these bugs still occur!
                    </p>

                    <p>
First update of the new year! Thank you to all who have continued to play Haikyuudle!! This update focuses on some quality of life in the character list, as well as the addition of Endless Mode! I hope I can continue to make Haikyuudle!! even better based on everyone's feedback this year. Thanks again for the support!

- Character List can now be sorted by a position filter, showing only characters that have a specific position. This also works with the team sort as well.
- Character List now saves where you last scrolled to, so that players don't have to scroll back down to where they were
- Added a button in the Character List at the bottom right corner that puts players to the top of the Character List
- Added Endless Mode, which starts out as locked, but is unlocked once players clear Normal Mode. Endless Mode gives players random characters to guess from Hard Mode's selection of characters.

Hey everyone! I know its been a bit since the last update, but I'm excited to finally release the picture update! Now you'll be able to see the characters in your guesses and the character list! It took a while to trim all the characters, but I hope it was worth it! Thank you so much for all the support! I really warms my heart to see more and more people play Haikyuudle!! 

NOTE: If you have the ability to guess characters, even if you have already won for that day, then that means you guessed before an update rolled out on that same day.

- Added pictures for every character!!
- Added Nametsu Mai
- Added Aone Takanobu (Timeskip)
- Fixed Teshiro Tamahiko having an incorrect position

Here's a much bigger update! This one aims to hopefully make the game easier to play and more clear! There's also some bug fixes so hopefully the game is a bit smoother now!

- Haikyuudle!! now has 2 modes! <b>Normal Mode</b> and <b>Hard Mode</b>!! Normal Mode only includes plot relevant characters and teams while Hard Mode includes every character in the series. Basically, Hard Mode is what this game has been since launch. Press the button with the people to swap between modes!
- If you beat both modes, you can see the full character list for each mode
- The Help and Info popup will now appear if it is your first time playing
- Fixed Shiratorizawa not being in the team search upon 7 and 9 guesses
- Fixed Mujinazaka High players being missing (They were listed as Nohebi players)
- Fixed Yudai (Timeskip) appearing twice in the character list
- Fixed tooltips not changing when going to light mode
- Changed the year to say "Adult" instead of 4 if the character is an adult
- Changed the position to say "N/A" instead of -1 if the character has no jersey number
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.3.1 9/1/2024</h2>
                    <p>

                    <h2>Version 1.3.0 8/30/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- As the hints have been adjusted, stats now save up to 9+. Unfortunately, 7+ wins will not be retroactively fixed
- Added 18 more timeskip characters
- Added a check where if you guessed a character and the correct character was their timeskip version (or vice versa), then their name would show up as green
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.2.1 8/29/2024</h2>

Thanks to some further suggestions, I have updated how hints and the character list are updated!
- Adjusted hint values. They now show up at 5, 7, and 9 respsectively (was 5 and 8).
- Added a new hint after 9 guesses. The character list will now also be sorted by a character's year
- Cleaned up the character list when sorting by school. If a school doesn't have a character in a certain position, the position's name is no longer shown for that school
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.1.1 8/20/2024</h2>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Version 1.1.0 8/20/2024</h2>
                    <p>
The second update! This one aims to fix a lot of issues that weren't caught when this site first came up.

- Added a 4th button to keep track of updates to the site
- Made guesses start at the top to prevent constant scrolling
- Made the site more mobile friendly
- The Character List will slowly pulsate when it has been updated upon the 5th and 8th guess
- Added light mode
- Hopefully fixed bug that prevented the game from resetting everyday

And HUGE shoutouts to all the friends who helped beta test the first version to help find bugs and issues! <b>(Lapis, Flower, Yukira, Semi, Knice, Comp)</b>

Happy Haikyuu Day!! 
    
This update didn't actually get a message until Version 1.1.0 since I really wanted to push a working Haikyuudle on Haikyuu Day! 
    
Though, it seems the site had some major glitches while I was out. Sorry about that! I promise to keep the site more stable going forward!
