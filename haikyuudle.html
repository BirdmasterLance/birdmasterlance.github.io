Hey everyone! I know its been a bit since the last update, but I'm excited to finally release the picture update! Now you'll be able to see the characters in your guesses and the character list! It took a while to trim all the characters, but I hope it was worth it! Thank you so much for all the support! I really warms my heart to see more and more people play Haikyuudle!!

NOTE: If you have the ability to guess characters, even if you have already won for that day, then that means you guessed before an update rolled out on that same day.

- Added pictures for every character!!
- Added Nametsu Mai
- Added Aone Takanobu (Timeskip)
- Fixed Teshiro Tamahiko having an incorrect position
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.4.3 9/11/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Normal guesses now properly reset when the day resets
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.4.2 9/10/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Lowered hint thresholds to 3, 5, and 7 respectively
- Fixed issue where character list would not correctly update upon hitting the final hint threshold
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.4.1 9/9/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Fixed the character lists not being correctly updated upon winning both Normal and Hard Mode
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.4.0 9/7/2024</h2>
                    <p>
Here's a much bigger update! This one aims to hopefully make the game easier to play and more clear! There's also some bug fixes so hopefully the game is a bit smoother now!

- Haikyuudle!! now has 2 modes! <b>Normal Mode</b> and <b>Hard Mode</b>!! Normal Mode only includes plot relevant characters and teams while Hard Mode includes every character in the series. Basically, Hard Mode is what this game has been since launch. Press the button with the people to swap between modes!
- If you beat both modes, you can see the full character list for each mode
- The Help and Info popup will now appear if it is your first time playing
- Fixed Shiratorizawa not being in the team search upon 7 and 9 guesses
- Fixed Mujinazaka High players being missing (They were listed as Nohebi players)
- Fixed Yudai (Timeskip) appearing twice in the character list
- Fixed tooltips not changing when going to light mode
- Changed the year to say "Adult" instead of 4 if the character is an adult
- Changed the position to say "N/A" instead of -1 if the character has no jersey number
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.3.1 9/1/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Adjusted some wording in the search box
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.3.0 8/30/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- As the hints have been adjusted, stats now save up to 9+. Unfortunately, 7+ wins will not be retroactively fixed
- Added 18 more timeskip characters
- Added a check where if you guessed a character and the correct character was their timeskip version (or vice versa), then their name would show up as green
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.2.1 8/29/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Fixed an issue where the 7th guess would show up at the top when the page was reloaded
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.2.0 8/29/2024</h2>
                    <p>
Thanks to some further suggestions, I have updated how hints and the character list are updated!
- Adjusted hint values. They now show up at 5, 7, and 9 respsectively (was 5 and 8).
- Added a new hint after 9 guesses. The character list will now also be sorted by a character's year
- Cleaned up the character list when sorting by school. If a school doesn't have a character in a certain position, the position's name is no longer shown for that school
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.1.1 8/20/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Added buttons on top left of each pop-up that close them incase clicking outside of them doesn't work
- Game now properly resets at 12 AM (was resetting at 5 PM)
- Share buttons should now actually go away when the game is resets
- Fixed an issue with some text in Character List not switching between light and dark mode
- Added an icon for the website in the tablist
- Minor formatting changes for mobile
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.1.0 8/20/2024</h2>
                    <p>
The second update! This one aims to fix a lot of issues that weren't caught when this site first came up.

- Added a 4th button to keep track of updates to the site
- Made guesses start at the top to prevent constant scrolling
- Made the site more mobile friendly
- The Character List will slowly pulsate when it has been updated upon the 5th and 8th guess
- Added light mode
- Hopefully fixed bug that prevented the game from resetting everyday

And HUGE shoutouts to all the friends who helped beta test the first version to help find bugs and issues! <b>(Lapis, Flower, Yukira, Semi, Knice, Comp)</b>
                    </p>

Happy Haikyuu Day!! 
    
This update didn't actually get a message until Version 1.1.0 since I really wanted to push a working Haikyuudle on Haikyuu Day! 
    
Though, it seems the site had some major glitches while I was out. Sorry about that! I promise to keep the site more stable going forward!
