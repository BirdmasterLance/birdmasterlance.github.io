Thanks to some further suggestions, I have updated how hints and the character list are updated!
- Adjusted hint values. They now show up at 5, 7, and 9 respsectively (was 5 and 8).
- Added a new hint after 9 guesses. The character list will now also be sorted by a character's year
- Cleaned up the character list when sorting by school. If a school doesn't have a character in a certain position, the position's name is no longer shown for that school
- Fixed issue where the 7th guess would show up at the top upon reloading
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.1.1 8/20/2024</h2>
                    <p>
- Added buttons on top left of each pop-up that close them incase clicking outside of them doesn't work
- Game now properly resets at 12 AM (was resetting at 5 PM)
- Share buttons should now actually go away when the game is resets
- Fixed an issue with some text in Character List not switching between light and dark mode
- Added an icon for the website in the tablist
- Minor formatting changes for mobile
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Version 1.1.0 8/20/2024</h2>
                    <p>
The second update! This one aims to fix a lot of issues that weren't caught when this site first came up.

- Added a 4th button to keep track of updates to the site
- Made guesses start at the top to prevent constant scrolling
- Made the site more mobile friendly
- The Character List will slowly pulsate when it has been updated upon the 5th and 8th guess
- Added light mode
- Hopefully fixed bug that prevented the game from resetting everyday

And HUGE shoutouts to all the friends who helped beta test the first version to help find bugs and issues! <b>(Lapis, Flower, Yukira, Semi, Knice, Comp)</b>

Happy Haikyuu Day!! 
    
This update didn't actually get a message until Version 1.1.0 since I really wanted to push a working Haikyuudle on Haikyuu Day! 
    
Though, it seems the site had some major glitches while I was out. Sorry about that! I promise to keep the site more stable going forward!
